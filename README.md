A complete dark-themed customization setup inspired by the Everforest color palette.

>**Dark-focused setup with optional light GTK theme variants.**

This project doesn‚Äôt just tweak a few config files ‚Äî it **downloads**, **installs**, and **applies** the necessary components (themes, icons, fonts, tools, wallpapers, and more) to fully transform your Linux environment into a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing setup.
